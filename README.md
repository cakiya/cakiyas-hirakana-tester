# cakiya's hirakana tester
A basic learning tool for Hiragana/Katakana* that shows the Romaji of a random Hirakana character for you to write down on a paper as practice.
*ONLY INCLUDES BASE HIRAGANA/KATAKANA (no diacritics aka ゛and ゜ or combos like きゃ - kya)

The Hirakana is chosen randomly, so each test will be in a different order.

_**This is a python script.**_

# What does this program do?
The program will give you the Romaji of a Hirakana character for you to write down on a piece of paper.

Once you have written it down, press ENTER and the test will show you the Hiragana and Katakana of that character, and move on to the next character.

After you get through all 46 Hirakana, the test will ask if you want to try again.

Simply close the window to exit.

- combos or whatever they're called (like きゃ - kya; the ones with 2 hirakanas)
- add ui
- perhaps 2 modes, current mode (flashcard mode) and a new tester mode that you can manually input if you got right or wrong then calculates score and tells you which ones you missed.
