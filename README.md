# cakiya's hirakana tester
a basic learning tool for hiragana/katakana that shows the romaji of a hirakana for you to write down on a paper as practice

ONLY INCLUDES BASE HIRAGANA/KATAKANA (no diacritics aka ゛and ゜)

HOW TO USE:

1. get python
2. get paper and pencil
3. run the script
4. follow the instructions
5. enjoy your hirakana test

To-Do/future features to add:
- Diactrics option (゛and ゜) (the list includes kakikukeko, but not gagigugego)
- combos or whatever they're called (like きゃ - kya; the ones with 2 hirakanas)
- try again feature because the script just ends after 1 test
